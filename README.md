## Running the Project

### Frontend

To start the frontend development server, follow these steps:

1. Navigate to the frontend directory:
    ```bash
    cd front
    ```
2. Install the frontend dependencies:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

2. Start the frontend development server:
    ```bash
    npm run dev
    ```

This will start the Vite development server and you can view your project at `http://localhost:3000`.

    ```

3. Start the backend server:

The backend server will start and listen on the port specified in your configuration (usually `http://localhost:3000/`).
